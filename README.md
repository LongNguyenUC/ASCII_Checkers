# ASCII_Checkers
A text-based checkers game playable in the console/terminal.

## How To Play
* Things to note are that Player 1 Pieces are represented by 'O' (normal piece) and 'K' (crowned/king piece). Player 2 pieces are represented by '0' (normal piece) and 'R' (crowned/king piece). An empty square is represented by '*'.
* Once a piece is picked, you cannot change it, unless it has no possible moves.

1. Install and run "main.cpp"
2. To choose a piece, input its position in the format 
`<Row><Column>`. For example, to move a checker piece in the 5th row and 0th column, type `50`. 
3. Once a valid piece is chosen, the program will display all the valid moves in the format `<Row><Column>`.
4. The program will repeat until a player gets all of their pieces captured.

Most importantly, have fun!
